# Hi, I'm Fabian Gonzalez 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead from Buenos Aires, Argentina, with over 10 years of experience in full-stack development, cloud solutions, and Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).  
Passionate about building fast, scalable web platforms, leading engineering teams, and delivering solutions that make a real impact.

I’ve worked with major global clients like **Unilever, Whirlpool, Keysight, Colgate-Palmolive, and First Century Bank**, developing high-performing web solutions, optimizing CMS workflows, and integrating AI and cloud-based systems.

Whether it's React, Java, Node.js, or AEM, I believe in clean code, accessibility, great UX, and constant learning.  
I also love mentoring developers, teaching tech, and empowering others through education.
